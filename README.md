# R and Python codes for estimating heterogeneous survival treatment effect via Machine/Deep Learning methods in observational studies. 
# We considered 3 machine/deep learning methods designed for right-censored survival outcomes: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees within the framework of 
# Accelarated Failure Time Model (AFT-BART) (Henderson et al. 2018) , Random Survival Forests (RSF) (Ishwaran et al. 2008) and Cox regression tool based on 
# deep neural network (DeepSurv) (Katzman et al. 2018). 
# Accompanying article is forthcoming.
